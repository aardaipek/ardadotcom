            <p>As a backend developer on a product-based team, my role involves developing new features and services while maintaining high standards of code quality and consistency. My primary programming languages are NodeJS and Typescript, and I also have experience with .Net Core. To support our development workflow, I frequently utilize a variety of AWS tools, including Lambda, EC2, and Cloudwatch. Additionally, I rely on various development tools such as RabbitMQ, Redis, PostgreSQL, and Docker.</p>
            <p>Also i work with 3rd party integrations on payment services. Such as Mastercard, IBBCard</p>
            <p>In my position, I not only write code, but I also review pull requests from my colleagues to ensure that our codebase remains clean, maintainable, and efficient. I understand the importance of collaboration in software development and strive to work effectively with my team to achieve our common goals.</p>
            <p>Overall, my experience and skillset make me well-suited for working on complex, feature-rich applications that require a high level of expertise in backend development and cloud infrastructure.</p>
